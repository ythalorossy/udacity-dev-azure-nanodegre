# Decissions

### Virtual Machines

I already have an application running internally. The planning is initially to migrate from barematel machines to Virtual Machines at the cloud.

The software developers and infra-structure team already have experience with the maintanence of the environment, building, continuous integration and deployment processes.

Even though the Virtual Machine are more expensive than App Service, will be more cheape to maintain the application in cloud than in bare-metal machines.
